# Lion image to ascii

A C++ Program that prints a given image as ascii characters to the console or saves it to 
a file if the  `-f` option is provided; it has kind of a faulty support for animating gif images and if you can figure it out I'll love your contribution


## Example 

![example](example.png)

## Usage

> You must have the Imagemagick program and Magick++ library to compile this program 

```sh

make

```

then run

```sh

```

After compiling just run ->

```sh

image-to-ascii imagePath [-r widthxheight] [-a asciichars] [-f filename]

```
